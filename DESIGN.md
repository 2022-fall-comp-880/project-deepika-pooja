### def write(self, filename: str):

    Data with anime moives
    
    filename: filename to write data to

* Write with open method with filename as `anime_info_file_obj`.

### def recommended_anime(self) -> list:

               4 .  yakushiji ryouko no kaiki jikenbo

* Define the inputs with enter the anime you like and number of recommendations to get the data from users.

* Then return the list on based on the inputs.

### def gross_avg(self) -> dict:

    Ranges are "1980-1990", "1990-2000",
        "2000-2005", and so on.
