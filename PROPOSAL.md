## Motivation
* Anime is a style of Japanese film and television animation,It aims to help answer questions in regard to popularity of anime, given their scores, popularity ranks, studios, etcetera. I think this dataset might be helpful for a plethora of uses, such as making recommendation systems, visualizing trends in anime popularity and score, predicting scores and popularity, and such. My project dataset contains the top 100 anime movies based on their rating. It also contains the anime's rating, number of votes, year, length of the movies and more.This is basically giving us an idea like what you want to see without it being curated and it being on preferences.

## Investigative Questions 
1. Based on rating's get the least created anime title?
2. What are the anime movies in different genre?
3. What is the average duration in each genre?
