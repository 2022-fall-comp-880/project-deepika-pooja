# Project Report
## Authors: Pooja Bandla and G. Deepika

## 1. Purpose 

- Anime is a style of Japanese film and television animation,It aims to help answer questions in regard to popularity of anime, given their scores, popularity ranks, studios, etcetera. I think this dataset might be helpful for a plethora of uses, such as making recommendation systems, visualizing trends in anime popularity and score, predicting scores and popularity, and such. My project dataset contains the top 100 anime movies based on their rating. It also contains the anime's rating, number of votes, year, length of the movies and more.This is basically giving us an idea like what you want to see without it being curated and it being on preferences.
- The data set of the project was taken from kaggle.com.
- The size of the dataset is top 100 animes with 8 different columns.
- On kaggle platform student kaggle master ayessa contributed the dataset with the latest update on October 31st and the dataset has been released under the Apache 2.0 open source license.

1. Based on the recommended anime and the number of recommendations get the animes more like those.
- Create a list of recommended anime and return a list of anime names that are related to the reference anime and return the top-rated animes if there are not enough recommendations.
2. In the given of year range get the average of gross value.
- Get the average gross. From the list of years identify the anime released in those years and calculate the average gross generated by those anime.
3. What is the average duration in each genre?
- Get the average duration of genre. Using list collected method identify the anime in those genre and calculate the average duration.


## 2. Approach

1. Based on the recommended anime and the number of recommendations get the animes more like those.
* To get to recommend anime first create a method `genre_list` to get the anime-names based on genre.
* In the method genre_list create the empty list as return_list to store the output.
* Create the for loop and assign the `self.dict`(contains the titles) to `d_s`.
* In for loop define the if statement and append the d_s to return list
* Return the `return_list` which return the result of anime-names .
* To create a list of recommended anime define the method `recommended_anime` with the parameters of anime_name which is string refers to the name of anime and num_rnd is integer refers to the number of recommendations required.If the given name is not in the self.dic then return nothing.
* Assign the self.dic of anime_name to anime_genre and create empty list as recommend.
* In for loop assign the anime_genre to r_m. Call the function genre_list with r_m to recommend.
* To remove the repetition in the return list use set to recommend list then remove the anime_name in the recommended which is not in that genre.
* If len of recommend is less than number of recommendations assign the for loop of self.dic to n_m.
* If n_m is not in recommend and not same to anime_name append the n_m to recommend.
* If length of recommend is equal to number of recommendations break the loop.
* Return to recommend based on number of recommendations.

2. In the given of year range get the average of gross value.
* Create the method `gross_avg` with the parameter of `year_list`.
* If the given year is not in the self.dic make it to zero and return zero.
* Create empty list gross_list to store the output.
* In for loop assign the self.dic to `g_a`.
* Append the self.dic of g_a and gross to gross_list.
* If given year doesn't have any gross avg make length of gross_list is equal to zero, return zero.
* Return the `sum of gross_list` to the `length of gross_list`.

3. What is the average duration in each genre?
* Create the method `avg_genre_dur` with the parameter of genre.
* If the given genre is not in the self.dic make it to equal zero and return zero.
* Create empty list dur_list to store the output.
* Create for loop and call the genre_list function of genre and assign to `a_d`.
* Append the self.dic of a_d and duration to dur_list.
* if the length of dur_list is equal to zero return zero.
* Return the sum of dur_list to the length of dur_list.

## 3. Testing 
* Use the unitest libraries for testing the testcases by using `import unittest`

* Use assert equal statement to justify the actual result is equal to expected result.


**def test_last_data(self):**
* Assign the test case last 5 movies data using test_last_data.txt.
* Define the actual_result over to the recommend anime and select the recommended movie and number of movies.

* Use assert equal statement to justify the actual result is equal to expected result.


**def test_full(self):**
* Assign the test case full data using test_full.txt.
* Define the actual_result over to the recommend anime and select the genre.
* Define the expected result that will be result the movies list based on number of recommendations.
* Use assert equal statement to justify the actual result is equal to expected result.

*Alternative ways of getting and testing the results*.

* `Pytest` can also be used for testing the results. It has benefits like supporting built in assert statement, filtering of test cases, returning from last failing test etc.


## 4. Results 

*def the method recommend_anime()->dict:* 
* To create the list of recommended movies the input will be the dictionary form and the return output will be in list form.

*def the method avg_gross()->float:*
* To get the average from the list of years identify the anime released in those years.The input is form of list and the return output will be in the form of float which the average of selected year over the class AnimeData.

*def the method avg_genre()->float:*
* To get the average using `genre_list()` method identify the anime in those genre and calculate the average duration. The input will be the string and the output will be in the form of float which is the average of selected movies over the class AnimeData.

## 5. Evaluation

### 5.1 What Works and Scope Assumptions ###

* By observing the data we got from the internet we assumed that the dats is correct through that we were able to find the movie recommended list based on the number of recommendations, average of the gross based on the year range and the average of the genre duration.

### 5.2 Immediate Further Development ###

*  To further development we can generate a rated method and get the most rated movies in the consider genre.
*  We can further develop the recommend method and get the genre list according to the user requirements.
